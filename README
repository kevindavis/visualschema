== Visual Schema

=== What is this thing??

A bit of an experiment with making it easier to define what's in your rails app.

In its current form it's a self-modifying application, but if people think it has any value I will try to figure out how to package it as a gem that people could use in their apps.

=== Why did you do x like y?
Ignorance most likely. One of the reasons for starting this project was to try to learn a few things. It is likely blindingly obvious that I've got a long way to go ;-)


Check out the TODO file for what changes I think need to come next. Yes, now that I put it on github I should probably use their issues thing. Feel free of course..
